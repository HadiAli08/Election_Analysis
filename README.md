# PyPoll_Challenge with Python

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Seth and Tom needed my help to create python code which will be able to calculate the election results by sorting through a large excel sheet full of data and return an easy to read text file that gives the results in an easy to read fashion. After completing this code and preparing to submit, the election commission requested that we add additional code to get more county based statistics such as voter turnout for each county, percentage of the votes each county got and the county with the highest voter turnout. They needed this saved to a election_results.txt file which I have done per request. 

## Election Results
- **How many votes were cast in this congressional election?**
	 There were a total of 369,711 votes in this congressional election.
- **Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct**
	 There were a total of 3 counties that participated in this election: Jefferson, Denver and Arapahoe. Jefferson had a total of 38,855 votes which accounted for 10.5% of all votes. Denver had the most votes at 306,055 votes which accounted for 82.8% of all votes. Lastly, Arapahoe had the least votes with 24,801 votes which made up 6.7% of all votes.
- **Which county had the largest number of votes?**
	 Denver had the most votes out of all the counties, totaling 306,055 votes or 82.8% of all votes.
- **Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received**
	 There were 3 candidates that participated in this election: Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Anthony Doane. Stockham had 23% of all the votes or 85,213 votes. DeGette had 73.8% of all votes or 272,892 votes. Doane had 3.1% of votes of 11,606 votes. 
- **Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?**
	 The winner of this election was Diana DeGette. DeGette had a total of 272,892 votes which accounted for 73.8% of all votes in the election.

## Election Summary
This script that I have created is very versatile which makes it a necessity for any future elections. I can easily modify the script at the request of the election committee to return any results they need, or modify it to use for any other elections. If the script was needed to be used for a presidential election I can modify the script to no longer look at counties and rather look at what direction each individual state has voted. Another option is for more local based elections such as schools. An example of this could be a class president election where a whole school will vote. I could rewrite this script to sort data by class/grade and output the results of which student candidates are favored to win. The options are endless with this script.
